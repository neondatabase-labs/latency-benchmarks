                This benchmark measures the latency between serverless functions and databases across different regions.
                It specifically focuses on the roundtrip time for executing a simple SELECT query.
                It also compares different connection methods of the Neon serverless driver: WebSocket vs HTTP.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">The measurements include:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1">

              <p>
                The benchmark uses the @neondatabase/serverless driver, which is specifically designed for serverless environments.
                This driver supports two connection methods:

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>HTTP connection:</strong> Faster for single-shot queries, stateless by design</li>
                <li><strong>WebSocket connection:</strong> More efficient for multiple queries in a single connection, supports more PostgreSQL features</li>
              </ul>

                The driver has several key characteristics:

                Note: This benchmark specifically measures single-shot query performance, which generally favors HTTP connections.
                The performance characteristics described below have been observed in our other benchmarks testing multiple query scenarios.

                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Faster for single-shot queries (~5-10ms advantage)</li>

                <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Ideal for serverless functions that execute a single query per invocation</li>

                The runtime environment also matters - Edge environments might prioritize cached HTTP connections differently

            <AccordionContent>
              <h4 className="font-medium">Cold Queries</h4>
              <p>
                A cold query is the first query executed against a database in a benchmark run. In Neon, this triggers a database startup
                as all benchmark databases have scale-to-zero enabled. This means the database is completely shut down after a period of inactivity
                and must be restarted for the first query.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                The benchmark cronjobs are specifically configured to run every 15 minutes to ensure that each database
                has had time to scale to zero between measurements, allowing us to consistently measure the cold start performance.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">The cold query latency includes:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1">
                <li>Database startup time from a scaled-to-zero state</li>
                <li>Connection establishment</li>
                <li>Query execution and result retrieval</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4 className="font-medium mt-4">Hot Queries</h4>
              <p>
                A hot query is executed immediately after a cold query in the same benchmark run. It represents the best-case
                scenario where the database is already running and ready to handle requests.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">The hot query latency primarily reflects:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1">
                <li>Network roundtrip time</li>
                <li>Query execution time</li>
                <li>Result retrieval time</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="mt-3">
                Measuring both cold and hot queries provides a comprehensive view of database performance across different scenarios.
                Cold queries show the worst-case latency when the database needs to start up first, while hot queries demonstrate
                the optimal performance once a database is already running.

            <AccordionTrigger>How often are benchmark requests made?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              <p>
                Benchmark requests are made every 15 minutes from each serverless function to each database. This interval is 
                specifically chosen to ensure that Neon databases have scaled to zero between measurements, allowing us to 
                accurately measure cold start performance.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                For each benchmark run:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1">
                <li>One cold query is executed first (hitting a scaled-to-zero database)</li>

                <li>Both measurements are stored in the stats database (not in the benchmark databases themselves)</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-2">
                This results in 96 measurements per day (4 measurements per hour × 24 hours) for each function-database pair,
                with each measurement including both a cold and hot query result. The table shows the average latency over the last 30 days.
