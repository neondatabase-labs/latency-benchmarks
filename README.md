# Neon Latency Benchmarks

A benchmark measuring latencies from Vercel serverless regions to Neon databases.

Visit it here: [latency-benchmarks-dashboard.vercel.app](https://latency-benchmarks-dashboard.vercel.app/demos/regional-latency)

## Components

- [./cron-vercel](./cron-vercel/): API deployed to Vercel that runs every 15 minutes to measure latencies from each Vercel region to all benchmark databases.
- [./dashboard](./dashboard/): Next.js dashboard displaying latency measurements.

## Setup

1. Run `bun run setup` in the dashboard directory to create the benchmark databases
2. Run `npm run deploy` in the cron-vercel directory to deploy the cronjob application using the Vercel CLI. This is necessary because we override the build directory with custom region configurations.
3. Deploy the dashboard application to Vercel.

## Benchmark Details

- Measurements every 15 minutes
- Each Vercel region queries databases across all AWS regions available on Neon
- Two measurements per iteration: cold and hot
- Special regions (us-west-2, us-east-1) test both HTTP and WebSocket connections
